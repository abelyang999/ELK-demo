# ELK-demo
Before using ELK for PlantUML, we need to have some [ELK working](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/) examples

The goal of this demo project is to have a snippet example for a very basic :

 * 3 nodes
 * 2 edges

 ![example](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/SoWkIImgAStDuKh9J2zABCXGIClFLwZcoijFIJLKY2xEI2n8jIrAJIw91GiPOGePemf1TUhQAO3LetADkRXgkHnIyrA05W80)
 
 As you can see, this example is very simple.
 
 **So now the challenge is here**: to implement automatic layout for this example.
 
Now we need your contribution :-)
We are really lost in ELK API.
